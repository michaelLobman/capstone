# Workout Programmer

Workout Programmer is a custom 20-week workout generator tailored to your current level of fitness.

## Description

Based on the concepts developed in Jim Wendler's 5-3-1 program, the Workout Programmer centers around four main compound movements: 

* Squat
* Bench Press
* Deadlift
* Military Press

The program consists of five four-week phases with specific rep/weight combinations based on your one rep maximum for each of the four main lifts. 

At the end of each four-week phase, the baseline maximum from which the workout weights are derived increases by five pounds for Bench Press and Military Press and ten pounds for Squat and Deadlift.

## Usage

### Signup Process

It all begins with the four main exercises.

The application will ask the user to enter the heaviest weight they have successfully lifted for each exercise as well as the respective number of repetitions completed.

Upon signing up, the application will calculate the user's one rep maxes and use those to generate the weights prescribed for each set of the 20-week workout.

### Workouts

Once the user logs in, workouts are displayed on the homepage for the user's current week. 

Each week, the rep scheme changes as the weights become progressively heavier, though remain below the user's calculated one repetition maximum. 

Every fourth week is a deloading week, consisting of lighter weights and meant to promote recovery before beginning the next phase.

#### Sets and Weights

Click on the exercises to open their respective accordion, revealing the specific weight needed for each set.

#### Plates

A "View Plates / Side" button displays which plates are needed on each side of a standard barbell to achieve the prescribed weight for the set (using the fewest number of plates, of course).

For instance, if the specified weight is 180 *lbs*, the popover will show:

* 45 *lb*: 1
* 10 *lb*: 2
* 2.5 *lb*: 1

If the specified weight is 185 *lbs*:

* 45 *lb*: 1
* 25 *lb*: 1

#### The Final Set

The final set of every week (with the exception of the deloading week every fourth week)

more on that later.
